# Library - Book-Identification-and-Tracking-System (BITS or LBITS)

## Library management system

The purpose of a library management system is to operate a library with efficiency and at reduced costs. 
The system being entirely automated streamlines all the tasks involved in operations of the library. 
The activities of book purchasing, cataloging, indexing, circulation recording and stock checking are done by the software. 
Such software eliminates the need for repetitive manual work and minimizes the chances of errors.

This project majorly focus on Object-Oriented_Programming(OOP). I created a library where student/anyone borrow books, return books, donate books to library and track all books which are taken by students/anyone.
